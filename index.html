                <h3>Yes, stay here! <br>
                    A birthday wish would look like that if your friend was Shakespeare. But no! I'm Riman Maharjan. So... <br> <br>
                    Remember me!! Though I've to say good-bye. <br>
                    Yes you messed that up but this song will be in my heart forever.<br>
                    Happy birthday girl, though you are transforming into a woman. But I'll always call you "girl". Only 1 year far to be officially able to watch GOT, inform me whenever you watch!!. Doraemon ko new movies haru chai sangai herni garam even though we reach 80s !! Still listinig to your playlist. kailai half playlist vanda uta jana vyaudaina. I'm sorry I couldn't complete this, hijo Ronaldo sub vayesi banauna thaleko... So ramro banauna vyayena and I also donno I will sent you or not!(lot of stuff are copied  but feelings are original). Where the hell this birthday wish going on... &#128128; Anyways, Birthday wish tai ho ki always stay happy, make everyone happy specially me, start talking to your sister, always be worthy to lift that Mjölnir(google gareko ho! &#128514;), stay just the way you are now.
                    <br> 
                    I don't think we have lot of time togther. Shortly and surely we might ran out of topic one day. Hope that insta reels may keep our convo alive(Ye sachhi tyo ni ramro aaudaina aajkal). I wish we met up earlier but it's ok as we both believe everything happens with the good reason. Suddenly "Life feels hard but it's OK" yad aayo, &#128514; and it's all because of you. Though our destiny was different I love how god managed to met us for atleast 2 years(hope many more to come, though it looks impossible, just believe the God) to show there is someone like us living the same life. I still don't know I'll sent you or not, and I don't know what on earth my freaking hands are typing, spelling ni khatrai mistake hola, feri padhni time ni xaina. I don't know what type of birthday massege is this, but I love wishing bithday informally to special persons. (Timi aile sutira hola.). Ok I'm ending now!! <br> Whenver hard times come in your life, remember "Water is boiling" and remember me, someone just like you living the same life somewhere in this earth. Remember you can share anything anytime and I'll be there to listen and understand anything! I still and always  remember those 5 golden days of my life between Christmas and New year! <br><br>
                    Thank You for everything!!
                    <br>
                    From: One and only <br>Mr.7
